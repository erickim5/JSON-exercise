# JSON-exercise
In this exercise, I work with JSON strings and files using packages such as numpy, pandas, and json.

Using data in file 'data/world_bank_projects.json',
I find the 10 countries with most projects
I find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
I clean up a dataframe by filling in missing values.

File: JSON data set of projects funded by the World Bank (436K compressed)
